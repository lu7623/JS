Hello! My name is Lyubov Agulova and I'm a student in the Rolling Scopes School frontend developer course. I’m studying here from December 2022.
I’m 31 years old, I was born in Voronezh, Russia, and now I live in Saint Petersburg . I graduated as a Bachelor of radiophysics from Voronezh State University in 2013. From my childhood I’ve been into technical sciences and math, in the university we practiced C++, Delphi and MathLab.

After university I moved to Saint Petersburg, gave birth to my child and started a small business  as self-employed. I’m currently working as a stained glass crafter in my small home workshop. I’m a self-taught glass artist  and I think self education is a strong point of my personality. Also running business gave me skills such as flexibility, resourcefulness, and persistence in achieving goals.

But recent events in my country  have forced me to think about immigration. I turned to my education and skills, and thought that a career in the IT field would help me be in demand in any country of the world. Now my main aim is to become a qualified Frontend Developer and move to Canada as a skilled worker
Before taking courses at the Rolling Scopes School, I’d been studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own for about three months.   I have finished The Web Developer Bootcamp in Udemy with Steve Colt , and several free courses on YouTube. Now in the process of learning my skills are supplemented with Git, SASS and Webpack. I’m impressed with the 1st stage final task - Minesweeper. Working on it is a good opportunity to implement all of my new knowledge.
In my free time, which is not so much, I study English and French, and prepare for the IELTS exam. Work and running social media for my craft takes a lot of time, but I try to study frontend for at least 20-30 hours a week 
It will soon be 9 months since I started studying frontend, and I think that I’m making good progress. All I want to do is to continue the journey into Web Development step by step and work hard to make my life better.
